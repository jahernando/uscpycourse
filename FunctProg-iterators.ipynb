    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Programming**, FP, is a computing paradigm that stablishes that a program is a set of functions, is a flow of functions that are evaluated in a serie. Each function takes an input and produces an output, it has no side effect, it always produces the same output for the same input. In FP data has no evolving states, that is, it does not change along the program. Data just flows between functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FP code is modular, reusable, and safe. Functions are small pieces of code, they can be re-arranged to create a new program and they are easy to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming is almost the contrary that Object Oriented programming. An OO program is composed of objects that have states, that evolve during the execution, and that relate between themselves. In general no paradigm is better that the other. Depending on the computational problem you want to solve you can chose one or the other. In some cases, both paradigms can live together. For example an composite (eclectic and heretic) approach is define data structures, that have states, as classes, with methods that change its state; and drive your program via functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python nicely supports functional programming, via mostly the **iterators** and **list expressions**. These the topics that we will cover in this notebook."

    "### 2. Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are an important ingredient in functional programming. It is very common that you want to execute a function over a set of items, a stream. Iterators are objects that represent that stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an iterator returns the next object in the stream when applying the *next()* method to it. When the end of the stream is reached, the iterator raises a *StopIteration* exception.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An object is iterable if it can provide an iterator. List, tuples, dictionaries and strings are iterables. The way to get the iterator is via the *iter()* builtin function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with *for* statements, we are in fact dealing with iterators. Here is a 'low' level code that shows how the list iterator works. When you are using the *for* statement, it simplifies most of this work for you!"
